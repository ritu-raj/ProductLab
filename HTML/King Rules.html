    <h1>#1 Build & Keep Building</h1>
    <p>
      <img src="C:\Code with Moss\Images\dumbbell.jpg" />
      What makes a man happy? It is when he builds & keeps building - be it his
      physique, assets, network
    </p>

    <h1>#2 Have a good EQ</h1>
    <p>
      Your thoughts' wavelength needs to match your partner's wavelength. The
      more the match, the merrier the relationship is!
    </p>

    <h1>#3 Choose wisely. Aim for long-term</h1>
    <p>
      Choose someone whose domain of work matches yours & whose thought-process
      ("mental wavelength" & beliefs) matches yours. Aim for a long-term
      relationship to have compounded growth & mental peace & bliss.
    </p>

    <h1>#4 Don't pry on others</h1>
    <p>
      When you have a relationship going on, don't allow your hormones to look
      outside your relationship. That's going to earn you bad karma!
    </p>

    <h1>#5 Be grateful. Keep pampering her.</h1>
    <p>
      Keep pampering her with small gifts from time to time. When she is grumpy,
      you can always go ahead & order her favorite ice-cream from her favorite
      ice-cream store
    </p>

    <h1>Some more rules...</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Try to evolve together in your relationship with your partner</li>

      <li>Maintain boundaries. At times, learn to say no</li>

      <li>Always be a keen observer of what your partner says & does</li>

      <li>
        Communicate effectively. Don't suppress your thoughts especially when it
        is important to express them
      </li>

      <li>
        Be good. Trust your partner & have faith. Believe in Karma! What goes
        around comes around!
      </li>
    </ul>
